            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>
                My UCF journey is quite a long and turbulent one. Though it started all the way back in 2018, it has
                taken until now for a clear path forward to emerge for me. For a very long time, I dreaded the
                moment when I would be leaving college since I had never truly decided what I wanted to do with my
                life. But this very semester has given me a big wakeup call, and shown me that there really is a
                path forward for me.

            <h3>The Past</h3>
            <p>
                When I graduated high school, I had only a vague idea of going to university to study tech-related
                stuff. Unfortunately, my first year at UCF was anything but smooth sailing. Between struggling to
                keep up with classwork, the lack of a rigid, pre-defined schedule, and a general feeling of
                isolation, by the time spring semester came around, I could hardly even make myself leave my dorm
                room to get food, much less to go to class. This was where my first time at UCF would end.
                <br>
            <p>
                Needless to say, I was very upset at the time. I was legitimately at a loss at what to do with
                myself. I was left questioning if I was capable of postsecondary education at all. And the most
                frightening question of all, what would happen to me if I wasn't?

            <h3>The Present</h3>
            <p>
                After several months of recuperation, as well as a diagnosis of neurodivergence and some light
                soul-searching, I would end up attending Valencia College. During my time there I gradually began to
                better understand what went wrong before. Through slowly developing strategies to overcome my mental
                barriers (and finally get a better understanding of how I work) and eventually my academic
                performance improved to where I was able to graduate with an A.A. degree and get readmitted to UCF.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>Since then, I have managed to keep the academic momentum going, and am now within a year of
                graduating with my bachelor's degree. Though I went at a timid pace at first, my academic pace has
                gradually quickened as time has gone on.

            <h3>The Future</h3>
            <p>
                To be totally honest, up to this semester I was still quite flexible about what I wanted to do after
                college. I had at least settled on jobs related to the digital media curriculun here, but I was
                undecided as to whether to focus on the game dev side or the web dev side. After this semester however,
                I think the decision has been made clear for me. Through this class (as well as my "Client-Side
                Scripting") class I've discovered how interesting web development can be, and I do believe I would be
                quite happy pursuing it as a job after graduation.
                <br>

            <p>
                I actually find it quite ironic that this is the class and field that has finally stuck for me. ALl the
                way back in that disatrous first year, the first class I took was an "Intro to C" programming class,
                which ended up being a disatrous experience for me and pushed me away from programming for years.

                Funny how things work out.
